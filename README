DriverPass seeks to revolutionize the process of studying for driving exams and scheduling practical driving test appointments for student drivers. Their goal is to create a comprehensive website that allows 
customers to register, purchase study packages, access online study materials and exams, and book practice sessions with licensed drivers. In addition, DriverPass employees should have the ability to purchase packages on
behalf of customers and manage their appointment schedules.

Throughout project 2, I developed diagrams that effectively conveyed the core concepts of the application,
ensuring clear understanding for stakeholders.

Reflecting on project 1, I acknowledge the opportunity to provide more detailed assumptions and limitations in the Business Requirements Document.
By expanding on these aspects, I could have provided a more comprehensive understanding of the project's scope.

To ensure a thorough grasp of the user's needs, I integrated insights from the technical requirements and conducted interviews.
This allowed me to create use cases and accompanying diagrams that accurately represented the user's requirements. By aligning these needs with the website's capabilities,
I prioritized user satisfaction, recognizing that they are the primary users of the site.

Distinguishing between functional and non-functional requirements proved pivotal in software design. Additionally,
the use of use case, UML, and Gantt diagrams proved invaluable for visualizing the application's intended functionality and facilitating comprehension among stakeholders.
